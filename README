Some things to now :
####################

You need to mount the cgroup virtual filesystems, at least the cpu and cpuset ones.

The profile file : a sample is provided, it should be sufficient for simple use of the injector.
	It contains several configuration options, and the profile of the injection.
	the config options are simple :
		name=... contain the name of the control groups, if unsure do not modify
		mount=... contain the mount point of the vfs ( the same as in mount_groups script).
	the profile :
		0 { ... } is the profile for cpuid 0 ( same as /proc/cpuinfo number)
		0 .. is an event : at this time (relative to the beginning of the injection) the following share of the cpu will be burned.
		between two events the share is constant.
		WARNING :  	always define times in full format : time 0 is 0 not 00 or 00:00 or whatever.
				event 0 is mandatory

Install notes :
###############

The Makefile contained in the src directory should be enough if you met the requirements.

For any other serious error, please contact us.

Requirements :
###############

	-- Linux kernel version 2.6.24 or above compiled with CONFIG_FAIR_CGROUP_SCHED and CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED options
	-- libcgroup, any version available on debian should be enough
	-- autotools
	-- Root access to your machine.

Using KRASH :
#############

Edit profile according to your needs :
	vi profile

Run krash
	sudo ./krash

Currently the only way to stop krash is by killing it. The SIGINT  signal is interpreted as
a stop command and clean the system of any load.
